# Easy_Quizz

This quizz is coded in python. 

### *Features*

Questions and answers are requested as input, as well as the number of guesses allowed.

Then the answers are cleared from the terminal for another person to try and find the answers!, 

Whitespaces are well managed, no need to forgo their usage.

### *Usage*

Just run the script with python ! 

```python
python Quizz.py
```
